# Full Stack Developer Challenge
This is an design and coding challenge for the role of Full-Stack Developer. Please feel free to fork. Pull Requests will be ignored.

## Requirements
Design a web application that allows employees to submit feedback toward each other's performance review.

*Partial solutions are acceptable.*  It is not necessary to submit a complete solution that implements every requirement. You are free to add additional functionality not listed here if you so choose, as long as you document your justification for doing so.

### Admin view
* Add/remove/update/view employees
* Add/update/view performance reviews
* Assign employees to participate in another employee's performance review

### Employee view
* List of performance reviews requiring feedback
* Submit feedback

## Challenge Scope
* High level description of design and technologies used
* Server side API (using a programming language and/or framework of your choice)
  * Implementation of at least 3 API calls
  * Implementation of 2-5 web pages using a modern web framework that talks to server side
    * This should integrate with your API, but it's fine to use static responses for some of it 
* Document all assumptions made
* Complete solutions aren't required, but what you do submit needs to run.

## How to complete this challenge
* Fork this repo in github
* Complete the design and code as defined to the best of your abilities
* Place notes in your code to help with clarity where appropriate. Make it readable enough that it is presentable.
* Complete your work in your own github repo and send the results to me.

## What are we looking for? What does this prove?
* Assumptions you make given limited requirements
* Technology and design choices
* Identify areas of your strengths
* This is not a pass or fail test, this will serve as a common ground that we can deep dive together into specific issues
